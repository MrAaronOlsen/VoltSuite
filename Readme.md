# Volt Suite
##### A simple 2d physics engine built to explain the systems, patterns, and algorithms of how it works.

# Getting up and running
### Prerequisites

##### You must have Ruby 2.6.5 installed.

I personally use RVM. [Install RVM](https://rvm.io/rvm/install).<br>
Then install Ruby `$ rvm install 2.5.6`.

Rbenv is a fine option too. [Install Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).<br>
Then install Ruby `$ rbenv install 2.5.6`.

##### You must have Bundler installed.
Install with `$ gem install bundler`

### Install Volt
```Bash
# Clone Repo
$ git clone https://github.com/MrAaronOlsen/VoltSuite

# Step into directory and run bundle
$ cd VoltSuite
$ bundle install
```
That's it! If all went well you can start running example applications.
